           <p>Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in Ethiopia, and now also grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia. They are an important crop for the economies of many countries.

            The drink is made from the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.
            
            To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked. This preserves them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted. Before the beans are made into a drink, they must be roasted or ground (crushed into tiny pieces in a coffee mill). When the ground coffee is placed into boiling water, the flavour and dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water. Making coffee is called brewing coffee. There are several different ways that coffee can be brewed.
            
            Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants.

        <p>True love these days can be found in a lot of creative places—online, at a bar, or the old-fashioned way, on a blind date. But to a true coffee lover, the relationship they want and need is found every morning (noon and night, sometimes!) at the bottom of their favorite mug. Black, cream, sugar, foam, no foam, these preferences could easily divide nations, it seems, because people LOVE their coffee a certain and often will not budge on changing it. Growing up in Seattle, where Starbucks is the Mothership, and craft coffee shops are found on every corner, I grew up thinking coffee and coffee culture was a normal way of life. But for many people, coffee is just what gets you going in the morning. You fill up your trusty thermos or travel mug with whatever you’ve got ground up or in a pod and you’re off for the day. So if that’s you, and you’d like to experience a deeper affinity and appreciation for one of God’s finest beverages, then look no further than these quotes. And if you’re on the hunt for what to buy your coffee-crazed friend or family member, look no further than our coffee lover gift guide!</p>
